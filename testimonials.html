I can not speak highly enough about our experience with Sandy. Staying in Robe we took the option of Sandy dropping The Tea Room off at the caravan park. 
When we turned up everything was set up and Sandy had even gone to the trouble of picking cool 'boy' doona covers for our three boys. 
She was always prompt with her replies and made some really good recommendations that enhanced our stay in the area.

Thank you Sandy. We hope to see you again in the future.

Had a lovely stay. The van was clean, spacious and had all the amenities needed. Sandy went out of her way to have kids bed linen, towels, heating and everything else. Next time Ill know not to bring much at all and it was hassle and stress free from being dropped off and set up for us. Kids had a ball and didnt want to leave their van. Thanks Sandy!

Fantastic stay in the Tearoom.
Had everything we needed and more.
Sandy could not have been more friendly and helpful and communication was prompt and accurate. Really enjoyed our time in Robe and would thoroughly recommend the Tearoom and Sandy to any family looking for a van and great service.

Brilliant! Highly recommend The Tea Room to anyone thinking of hiring a Van, especially at Robe. Sandy was extremely helpful and nothing was too hard, which made our Xmas getaway even better. We will definitely be using The Tea Room again in the future.

What an amazing caravan, My family of 2 adults and 2 small children had an absolute blast staying in this caravan. Everything is in new condition, with comfortable beds and block out blinds, we were happy that we were only woken up by our kids and not the morning sunlight.
The owners of the tea room are what made our experience absolutely remarkable, they went way beyond expectations to ensure we had everything we needed, supplies were provided for tea, coffee including sugar and fresh milk. An extra warm blanket and cushions, even an extra heater just in case we got cold.

If you are after a fuss free, relaxing weekend away, I can highly recommend booking the tea room.
