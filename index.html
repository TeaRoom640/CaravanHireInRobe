<p class = title style = "font-size:1em;text-align:left;">Minimum 4 night bookings off peak. Minimum 5 night bookings peak time (school holidays etc) <br> <br>

As of 23/11/19 - We are now taking bookings for 2020. <br> <br>

Please note, we wish to keep the van in great condition. Any bookings agreed are subject to approval based on discussion. If you wish to tow, we will consider amount of nights, distance, wear and tear factors, towing experience. <br> <br>
Thank you so much to the lovely families that have stayed in 'The Tea Room' so far. Everyone has been so helpful in keeping the van in great condition. The reviews are much appreciated. We would gladly welcome each family again. It has been heartening to meet such lovely people. <br>
<br> About our expanda: <br>
Our 2017 van is very clean, modern and spacious. It is compact to tow but after an easy set up, it provides spacious accommodation. It has great heating and cooling with a good sized fridge and cupboards to stock up on goodies. Internal storage options are abundant to help keep the van tidy.
 Looking forward to meeting you, Sandy - caravan owner. </p> </div>
