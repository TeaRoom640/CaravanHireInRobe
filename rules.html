<h2> Hiring Terms of Hire </h2>
<p>Minimum 5 night bookings during peak periods. Long term hire by negotiation at reduced rates.
We are happy to tow it to one of the lovely caravan parks at Robe subject to the hirer having a confirmed booking and site allocated. 
It is up to the hirer to inform any caravan park of number of persons using the site. We are happy to set up and meet/greet at an agreed time.
We are happy to tow to private land subject to receiving confirmation from the land owner that permission has been granted. You would need an electricity supply.
Hirer must be 25 years of age or older. </p>

This is a modern family owned van and we hope that apart from having a great holiday, you will treat it kindly and help to keep it in great condition.
